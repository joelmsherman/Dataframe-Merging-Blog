# Merging Dataframes in Pandas

## Objective
As I learn new tools and packages in Python, my goal is to synthesize the information I've learned on datasets near and dear to my heart, work them into a notebook, and try to teach others through blog posts on the topic. This post will be aimed at basic dataframe merging in Pandas.

## Datasets 
Data is cycling training, sleep and recovery data from various sources as follows:
- Training & Recovery - data on training (including duration, TSS, etc.) and recovery (readiness) is training_recovery.csv
- Sleep - data on sleep is sleep.csv
